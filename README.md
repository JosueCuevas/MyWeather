# My-Weather-App

This is a weather app developed for apply all the main concepts about React.js library, such concepts like Components, Hooks, Context, Styled Components and React router. This was the second version of my first React project which I ever worked and I feel really proud of it.

It was made using <a href="https://vitejs.dev/">vite</a> and the PWA vite plugin so I am really grateful with all people who make this process easier. :P

In my opinion this is a really intuitive software, it does not require such a high level of coding to understand this code. In this version I've improved some issues and bad practices that it has in the past, now it's not completely necessary users give their geo-location in order to work well, we respect their privacy and their decisions

The interface it is also really simple, Whoever is reading this I would be really grateful if you recommend this project with some of your fellas.

Please feel free to send any comments to my personal email: hola@josuecuevas.com

Have a great day!

See you! ;)
